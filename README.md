# todolistprojectcrud-back-end
### ToDo List

This project was created with the main objective of learning MongoDB database  and understand how the connection between back-end and front end works. Front-end was created with ReactJs.

For this project I followed a MongoDB tutorial shared in MongoDB page. (**see links to tutorial bellow**).

Also I checked the API connections wtih Postman App and the database structured with MongoDB Compass, (**see links to tutorial bellow**).

Other tool used was Express  to create routes and test errors.

Finally the front-end was made with Reactjs, you can see more detailed information about the project on this link:  https://github.com/dianachavezr/-todolistprojectcrud-front-end
